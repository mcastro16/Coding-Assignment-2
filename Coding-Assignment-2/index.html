      <font size="+3;">1) University of California - Berkeley/Downtown Berkeley</font><br>
      <p>University California - Berkeley was one of my top choices for Computer Science, not just because of the computer science program and the bay area, but because it has such a beautiful campus.
        The UC Berkeley Campus is very well kept with a diverse student body that is just as diverse as SFSU's. It is also a very nice place to just walk through in general. With a multitude of libraries
        and a plethora of iconic buildings and places to eat, UC Berkeley and Downtown Berkeley are places to definitely go to if you want to explore beyond San Francisco/Oakland. On top of that, these
        areas are accessible via Bart and the F bus, which you can charge to your clipper card. The link to the UC Berkeley Home page is clickable via the image.

      <font size="+3;">2) U :Dessert Story</font><br>
      <p>U:Dessert Story is a eatery in Berkeley that has been my favorite spot out of all the resturants I have tried in said area. The menu is one of a kind, giving options such as Matcha Mochi Pancakes,
        Thai Tea Crepe Cakes, and Mango Matcha Fresca drinks to name a few. With a nice and cozy interior design, and the need for proof of vaccination for indoor dining, I would confidently say that it is a
        nice place to grab a bite to eat if you are in need of satisfying your sweet tooth. However, do be warned that the dishes are around $15 worth, I think it is worth the try.
        The shop is just outside the campus from UC Berkeley, so it is also very accessible. The link to the U:Dessert Story page is clickable via the image.

      <font size="+3;">3) Pier 39</font><br>
      <p>Pier 39 is the famous seaport where you can go grab or see everything from San Francisco's notoriously good Clam Chowder from Boudin's to the sea lions that perch up on the wooden platforms next to the
        port. As iconic as the spot is, there is plenty to do and plenty to see. It is a nice spot to walk around and grab lunch/dinner, thus being a very popular tourist population. The pier gives an excellent
        view of Alcatraz Island as well as the Golden Gate Bridge, depending what side you are standing on. The bridge is accessible via the MUNI, which is preferred since parking can be a bit difficult and expensive
        if you choose to use the public parking structures around the area. All in all, a nice tourist attraction with good eats. The link to the Pier 39 info page is clickable via the image.

      <font size="+3;">4) Mission Dolores Park</font><br>
      <p>Mission Dolores Park is one of the many parks in San Francisco that is now back to being completely open to the public. Mission Dolores Park is a dog friendly park that is essentially built on a hillside,
        making it optimal for the little concerts that are supposedly being held there later into the year and in 2022. The Park is also in the heart of San Francisco, making it a great spot to lay down and relax
        with friends and loved ones after a meal or after exploring the stores and streets that surround it. Being a couple blocks down from the BART and right next to MUNI stop via the J MUNI train, this spot is
        also a perfect spot for a picnic or even just to stop by and take a break and view the skyline of San Francisco. It also has a playground apparatus for the kids to play on and a couple, closed gate, tennis courts. Although it faces a lot of foot
        traffic, it still is a beautiful spot to check out. The link to the Mission Dolores Park info page is clickable via the image.
